Team 5071 Programming Guide
===================================
Welcome to the FRC Team 5071 programming guide!

The purpose of this guide is to document everything this team has learned and help future generations of robotics members.

These guides assume you already know basic Java and how the ``TimedRobot`` class works in ``wpilib``.
If you do not already, it may be helpful to read the documentation `here <https://docs.wpilib.org>`_.
